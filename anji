It has exhaustive help information and clutter free interface that suits the needs of all users. Torrentz.eu is one of the most popular BitTorrent indexing sites globally and has been operating for over ten years. Rather than a conventional BitTorrent indexing site, Torrentz.eu is a “meta search engine” (i.e. an aggregator) of 28 third party sites, including ThePirateBay, KickassTorrents, ExtraTorrent, Bitsnoop and Torrentdownloads. The site boasts that it indexes over 32 million active torrents from more than 126,000,000 pages on 26 domains. The site currently has a global Alexa ranking of 477 and is ranked 803 in the US. SimilarWeb traffic data show an average of 146 million site visits a month.

As with The Pirate Bay and KickassTorrents, rights holders have resorted to taking legal action to have ISPs block the site. The site is now blocked by ISPs in the UK, Belgium and Denmark.

In July 2015, it was reported that Google Chrome had started blocking access to the site due to the site containing “harmful programs.”

Torrentz has shutdown voluntarily. Torrentz2 is replacing the original torrentz now.
